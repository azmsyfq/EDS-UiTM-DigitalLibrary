              Absulum the Reindeer Elf<br>
              worked in the reindeer barn.<br>
              He had to clean it everyday<br>
              and that was rather hard<br>
              for it was such a dirty job<br>
              to mop and slop and scour and scrape<br>
              every corner, nook and cranny<br>
              in that reindeer place.<br>

              <br><img src="\assets\books\absulum\shovel.gif" width="176" height="174" border="0" alt=""><br>

              <br>
              Absulum the Reindeer Elf<br>
              had to keep the reindeer groomed.<br>
              He had to give them all a bath.<br>
              He had to feed them too.<br>
              Cook their meals, brush their fur<br>
              and fill that barn with hay<br>
              and every morning when he woke<br>
              he would have to do it all over again.

              <br><br>
              Absulum the Reindeer Elf<br>
              played nurse and doctor too.<br>
              He took care of all the reindeer<br>
              if they were sick or had the flu.<br>
              He fixed their sleigh, he mended their reins<br>
              and if they were sad he would wipe their tears.<br>
              He worked his fingers to the bone<br>
              but it seemed that no one cared.

              <br><br>
              Of course the elves in Santa's Workshop<br>
              they were such a happy lot<br>
              singing songs all day long<br>
              with that jolly happy Santa Claus.<br>
              They laughed and danced from toy to toy<br>
              as if it was such fun<br>
              while outside in the reindeer barn<br>
              was the Elf named Absulum.

              <br><br>
              Absulum the Reindeer Elf,<br>
              when he heard that happy noise,<br>
              would wish he was a Workshop Elf<br>
              making Christmas toys;<br>
              but a Workshop Elf is wise and tall<br>
              and Absulum was not<br>
              and that was why he was in that barn,<br>
              well that is what he thought.

              <br><br>
              Now, it was on a Christmas Eve<br>
              when this incident occurred,<br>
              Santa's sleigh was flying high<br>
              there was no reason for concern<br>
              until the wind came up<br>
              and the snow came down<br>
              in a blinding wall of white<br>
              and all the reindeer say<br>
              that it set the stage<br>
              for the tragedy that took place that night.

              <br><br>
              Through that snow the reindeer flew<br>
              with neither fear nor fright<br>
              but the wind grew strong<br>
              and stronger still<br>
              until a blizzard grabbed<br>
              that Christmas night.<br>
              And it shook that night,<br>
              it shook the sky<br>
              and it shook that reindeer sleigh.<br>
              The reindeer they could hardly see<br>
              so soon they lost their way.

              <br><br>
              They were tumbling twisting<br>
              turning topsy-turvy<br>
              'round and 'round.<br>
              They hit the tree tops<br>
              flipped the sleigh<br>
              and smashed into the ground.<br>

              <br><img src="\assets\books\absulum\falling.gif" width="313" height="363" border="0" alt=""><br>

              <br>
              The reindeer sleigh was broken<br>
              it was scattered everywhere.<br>
              There were parts and pieces on the ground<br>
              over here and over there.<br>
              Christmas toys torn from their wrapping,<br>
              ribbons tangled in the trees<br>
              and there upon the forest floor<br>
              lay Santa Claus, and all could see<br>
              that he was hurt from the tragic crash<br>
              but just how bad no one would ask.<br>
              For asking might be finding out<br>
              an answer no one cared to know.

              <br><br>
              The reindeer gathered 'round him<br>
              each one limping, scraped or cut<br>
              and one by one they called his name<br>
              "Oh, Santa Claus? Get up!"<br>
              But not one move did Santa make<br>
              not a flicker not a sound<br>
              and every single reindeer there thought,<br>
              "What will we do now?"

              <br><br>
              The sky was black there was no light<br>
              no moon or shining star.<br>
              The reindeer huddled close for warmth<br>
              around Santa Claus who was lying there<br>
              in such a heap of sadness<br>
              pines and twigs caught in his beard.<br>
              Then one reindeer thought out loud<br>
              "If only Absulum was here."

              <br><br>
              Then suddenly the reindeer,<br>
              well they all began to chant.<br>
              "Absulum oh Absulum<br>
              do you know where we're at?<br>
              Oh Absulum, Absulum<br>
              please come we need you now!<br>
              Absulum, Oh Absulum,"<br>
              the reindeer chanted loud.<br>
              "Absulum, Absulum<br>
              can you hear us call?<br>
              Absulum? Absulum?<br>
              Absuuuulllllummmmmm?<br>

              <br><img src="\assets\books\absulum\landing.gif" width="302" height="379" border="0" alt=""><br>

              <br>
              Suddenly a star lit up<br>
              that stormy Christmas sky<br>
              and it fell toward the Earth<br>
              and landed there at Santa's side.<br>
              The reindeer all stepped back<br>
              and gasped in wonder at the sight<br>
              of Absulum the Reindeer Elf<br>
              and the star he brought for light.

              <br><br>
              He placed that star upon a tree<br>
              and it filled the Christmas sky<br>
              then quickly down with reindeer 'round<br>
              he was there at Santa's side.

              <br><br>
              Then on his knees the Reindeer Elf<br>
              he breathed a single breath of life<br>
              into his mouth and as he did<br>
              Santa opened wide his eyes.<br>
              "Absulum?" Said Santa Claus.<br>
              "Absulum, is that you?"<br>
              but Absulum did not answer<br>
              for there was too much work to do.

              <br><br>
              He held his hand up to his mouth<br>
              and let loose the oddest scream<br>
              that echoed through the forest<br>
              through the mountains and ravines.

              <br><br>
              Now, that scream? It was a creature call,<br>
              one he learned when he was young.<br>
              It was a call that creatures answered to<br>
              and caused them all to come.<br>
              And come they did<br>
              from hovel, hole,<br>
              from cavern, nest and tree<br>
              to offer help<br>
              to a Reindeer Elf<br>
              who was in his hour of need.

              <br><br>
              Within seconds Squirrel<br>
              and Moose and Deer<br>
              were there upon the scene.<br>
              Raccoon, Fox and Bobcat came<br>
              and every bird from every tree.<br>
              And every bunny rabbit hopped<br>
              and those who had to crawled<br>
              to take part in the rescue<br>
              of the reindeer and Santa Claus.

              <br><br>
              Each part and piece of Santa's sleigh<br>
              was gathered from the wreck<br>
              and brought to Absulum the Reindeer Elf<br>
              who began to put the pieces back.<br>
              The reins were mangled, tangled torn,<br>
              the runners snapped in two<br>
              but Absulum the Reindeer Elf<br>
              knew exactly what to do.

              <br><br>
              And so, while he worked on Santa's sleigh,<br>
              the creatures all pitched in<br>
              to gather up the toys<br>
              that were scattered by the wind.<br>
              They put the toys back in their wrapping,<br>
              tied the ribbons, filled the sack.<br>
              By then that sleigh was good as new<br>
              so, they threw the sack in back.<br>
              Then they helped old Santa to his feet<br>
              and up onto the sleigh.<br>
              The reindeer they got in as well<br>
              wherever they could find a space.

              <br><br>
              Then Absulum the Reindeer Elf,<br>
              he called the creatures 'round.<br>
              He placed the reins upon them all<br>
              and said, "We're taking Santa home".<br>
              Then up into the drivers seat<br>
              that tiny elf did climb.<br>
              He took the reins<br>
              and without delay<br>
              commanded them to fly.<br>

              <br><img src="\assets\books\absulum\sleigh.gif" width="494" height="393" border="0" alt=""><br>

              <br>
              Well, that sleigh took off<br>
              it left the ground<br>
              and headed straight into the sky<br>
              being pulled by Moose and Bunny Rabbits<br>
              and creatures who weren't meant to fly.<br>
              But fly they did and how or why<br>
              is not an answer we need know.<br>
              You see the question most important is,<br>
              "Did they get them home?"

              <br><br>
              Well, yes they did.<br>
              They got them home<br>
              and quickly took them in.<br>
              Missus Claus fed them chicken soup<br>
              then she called to Absulum.<br>
              She said, "Absulum, look outside<br>
              there are toys still in the sleigh.<br>
              You have to get back out there<br>
              and deliver them right away."<br>

              <br>
              Absulum looked at Missus Claus.<br>
              He knew she was in charge<br>
              but, instead of following her orders<br>
              he took his reindeer to the reindeer barn.<br>
              He tended to their injuries<br>
              all that night and all the next day<br>
              and as for all those toys outside<br>
              well, that is where they stayed.

              <br><br>
              Because Reindeer Elves<br>
              concern themselves<br>
              only with what's right<br>
              and when taking care of reindeer<br>
              is all you know in life<br>
              then you do what must be done<br>
              to make sure those reindeer never come to harm<br>
              and so, now you know<br>
              why Absulum works in the Reindeer Barn.<br>
