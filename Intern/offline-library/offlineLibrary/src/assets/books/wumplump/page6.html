And the Wumpalump was true. He sent his Word. He sent his little love 
lump into the world to save the world from the nothingness.
</p>
<p>
<img width="25" height="2" src="whtdot.gif">
And the little love lump was in the Wumpalump. And all
the Wumpalump's love, joy, and peace were in his Word.
</p>
<p>

And the little love lump felt all the Wumpalump's health and wholeness and 
as he touched the little lumps who thought they lacked... they were made 
whole. And as he touched the little lumps who thought they were hungry... they
were filled.
</p>
<p>
<img width="25" height="2" src="whtdot.gif">
And the little love lump went about giving all his father's love, joy, and 
peace. And as these things flowed through him the nothingness melted.
</p>
<p>
<img width="25" height="2" src="whtdot.gif">
But some little lumps there were who did not understand for they still looked 
to the nothingness. They still saw what they lacked. They wanted a rich, 
powerful little lump to subdue the other little lumps and take away the
loneliness, pain, and confusion.
</p>
<p>
<img width="25" height="2" src="whtdot.gif">
But the little love lump refused to subdue anyone. "Be perfect," 
he said, "As the Wumpalump is perfect. For he maketh his rain to fall 
on the just and the unjust!"
</p>
<p>
<img width="25" height="2" src="whtdot.gif">
This made the little lumps mad. "But we want to be saved!" they shouted. 
"Save us! Save us! Where is the kingdom you promised?"
</p>
<p>
<img width="25" height="2" src="whtdot.gif">
But the little love lump refused. "My kingdom is not of this 
world," he said. And within he felt all love, all joy, all peace... 
the gentle touch of the Wumpalump.
