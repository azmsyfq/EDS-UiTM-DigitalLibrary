So one day when she thought no one was watching she shared the seed 
with little lump 1. "Let us find what we are lacking," she said. "We 
will have wisdom as the Wumpalump if we do." And because little lump 
1 agreed with little lump 2 that this was good... they both looked to the
nothingness and were surprised at what they saw.

"Why, we lack all things!", they shouted. And emptiness and dread filled 
them. And they heard the Wumpalump walking as a breath of wind for no 
longer did they feel him within. And they ran and covered themselves with
the clothes they lacked.
</p>
<p>

And the Wumpalump was surprised when he saw them. "Who
told you that you lacked clothes? Did you look to the 
nothingness as I warned you not to?"
</p>
<p>

Little Lump 1 was afraid. "Little lump 2 told me", he
said trembling. And little lump 2 trembled even more. "The
seed told me," she exclaimed.
</p>

And the Wumpalump looked upon the two little lumps with great sadness 
because they had chosen the nothingness over all love, all joy, and all 
peace. With tears in his eyes he told them the wisdom they had found. "From 
now on," he said, "you will feel loneliness, pain, and confusion.. for
you have looked to the nothingness. In sorrow will you share creation."
</p>
<p>

But because the Wumpalump was all love, all joy, and all peace, he had 
compassion on the little lumps. "One day I will destroy the seed," he 
promised. "One day I will send my Word. Then no longer will you look to 
the nothingness. Then no longer will you feel loneliness, pain, and confusion!
