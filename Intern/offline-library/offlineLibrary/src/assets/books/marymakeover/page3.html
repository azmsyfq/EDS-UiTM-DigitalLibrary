<p>The Monster yelled "BOO!" to give Mary a scare,<br>
But Mary just fixed the great Beast with a stare.<br>
She looked up and down from his toes to his hair<br>
With total disdain while the Monster stood there.</p>

<p>"Why!" asked the Monster "You show me no fear!?"<br>
<nobr>"Have&nbsp;you&nbsp;looked&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;mirror?&nbsp;You're&nbsp;just&nbsp;SOOO&nbsp;last&nbsp;year!</nobr><br>
Your tail isn't bad, but is there a reason...<br>
For sporting those horns, which are just SOOO last season?</p>

<p>The Monster was stunned. At a loss what to say.<br>
His prey wasn't screaming or running away!<br>
He wasn't accustomed to such a response,<br>
He was used to HYSTERICS not pert nonchalance.</p>

<p>But Mary stayed poised as a lady should be,<br>
She displayed no attempt or desire to flee.<br>
She turned on the light so that he could see clearer<br>
And showed the big Monster his FACE in the mirror.</p>

<p>He gawked for a while at his wretched reflection<br>
He winced at his wrinkled and withered complexion.<br>
"My skin feels like leather, I have crusty eyes!"<br>
"What did you expect when you don't moisturize?"</p>

<p>"My nails are all broken! My teeth are all yellow!<br>
My fur is in clumps!" He let out a BELLOW!<br>
"My horns are askew and my coat is molting."<br>
He started to sob... "I am... truly... revolting!"</p>

<p>"Come on now don't cry." Said Little Miss Mary.<br>
"You DO have a choice, you don't HAVE to be scary!<br>
Behind that snarl and that piercing stare,<br>
You're just a big softy - a HUGE teddy-bear!"</p>

<p>But the big hairy Monster was not quite as certain -<br>
Embarrassed he wrapped himself up in a curtain<br>
And told Little Mary that with-out a doubt,<br>
He's a HIDEOUS creature and he'll NEVER come out.</p>

<p>Miss Mary agreed: "You are ugly for sure,<br>
But it's something you really don't have to endure.<br>
So you haven't been blessed with the best of genetics;<br>
Who needs Mother Nature, when we have cosmetics!?</p>

<p>For each of your problems you'll find there's a cure<br>
From a deep cleansing facial to a French pedicure.<br>
To NUMEROUS methods for rogue hair removal<br>
So what do you say? Do I have your approval?</p>

<p>Would you like to be pampered and fashioned and styled?<br>
MADE-OVER BY MARY?" - The big Monster smiled.</p>

<p>"I can tell from that smile that it's been quite a while<br>
Since you've seen a toothbrush, or have used a nail-file.<br>
And I sense from your stench, or at least I presume,<br>
That you're also a stranger to soap and perfume."</p>

We'll soak you and clean you, we'll scrub and we'll scour.</p>

<p>We'll cleanse and we'll tone, we'll wax and we'll pluck,<br>
We'll snip and we'll peel, we'll nip and we'll tuck!<br>
If you want to look pretty you're on the right path.<br>
Lets start with the basics... You're having a bath!"</p>
