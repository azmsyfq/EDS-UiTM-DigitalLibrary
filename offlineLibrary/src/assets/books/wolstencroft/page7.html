<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then one frosty evening when the stars were sparkling in the night sky and snowflakes were dancing past the windows, a little boy and his daddy came into the store.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey look at this," said the daddy when he noticed Wolstencroft's name tag. "This teddy bear has the same name as you! Only you're called Sten for short and he's called Woolly."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The boy called out in surprise. "I didn't think anyone else in the whole great big world was called Wolstencroft."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just like Wolstencroft the bear, he was beginning to hate his name.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you two get to know each other?" the daddy suggested as he lifted Wolstencroft down from the shelf.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the little boy wrapped his arms around his namesake, which means someone who has the same name as yourself, and stroked his soft fur. And they both loved each other from that moment on.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love him daddy, can I have him for Christmas?" he asked hopefully. And when his daddy said yes, danced around the store with Wolstencroft, almost colliding with other shoppers as he did so.
</font></p>

<p align="CENTER">

</p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolstencroft really wasn't such a bad name after all they both decided as they whirled around the Christmas tree at the front of the store. In fact, it was starting to sound better all the time now that they had found each other in this wonderful way.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolstencroft the bear had never remembered feeling this happy before. Indeed, he felt so chock-full of joy that he thought he just might burst. He was going to a new home at last. And he knew that this little boy, who was called Sten, would be his very best friend forever.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sten gave him a hug so big that his tummy was squished. But, of course, Wolstencroft didn't care. Because no hug is too big for a teddy bear.
