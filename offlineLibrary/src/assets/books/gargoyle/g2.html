<font size="4">"Dry me," said gargoyle one.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="4">"No, me first," said the other one.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="4">Wendy didn't scream because the directions said they'd be real cranky. "Okay, I'll dry you both." Wendy dried them off with towels.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="4">Wendy named one Lester and the other one Tina, because one of them was a boy and the other one was a girl. When Wendy was off at school, they'd get into pillow
fights and make her room a mess.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="4">"You have to clean up your room," Mrs. Delane said. "Your Dad almost fainted when he saw your room."</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="4">"But Lester and Tina made the mess."</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size="4">"They're your gargoyles and you have to clean up after them."</font>
