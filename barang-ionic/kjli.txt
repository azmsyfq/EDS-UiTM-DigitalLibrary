 On the first day of our industrial training, we were told about the tasks we will be given. The task that was given to me is to create a web app of a Digital Library. We were told to operate the task by using Ionic, which is HTML5 Mobile App Development Framework targeted at building hybrid mobile apps, which is also a front-end HTML framework on top of AngularJS and Cordova. AngularJS is for building rich single page applications optimized for mobile devices. While Cordova plugins offer API needed for using native device functions with JavaScript code. And some other components such as CSS and Javascript were also crucial for the Ionic. So at first, it was kind of confusing. But as we do some research about it, we figure that we can do this.
