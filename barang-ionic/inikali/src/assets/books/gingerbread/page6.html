      <p>Smiling, the wily fox glanced at the butterfly before turning to the little gingerbread man, "You're going to carry him? I've no doubt Ms. Butterfly that you have good intentions, but you're only a bug. You couldn't carry anything anywhere, let alone this gingerbread man across the stream. You'll drop him. I guarantee it!"</p>

      <p>The little gingerbread man was confused. He knew that his butterfly friend had good intentions but could she really carry him? He doubted it. Her wings were so thin and delicate. The thought of him falling into the cold water and crumbling to damp bits was frightening. He said to the fox, "I outran children. I outran a horse, and I outran a dog. Will you keep me safe and not eat me?"</p>

      <p>"Of course!" the wily fox quickly assured him before the butterfly could object. "I eat only meat and I had a full meal just before my nap. Here, ride on my bushy tail. Let's go before I change my mind."</p>

      <p>So the little gingerbread man climbed onto the fox's tail and they entered the water.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately the fox's tail began dipping into the water. "You're too heavy for my tail, he said. Climb onto my back."</p>

      <p>The little gingerbread man did as he was asked.</p>

      <p>But the water began creeping up the fox's back forcing the little gingerbread man to climb higher to the fox's neck. "That's not good enough, I'm afraid," said the wily fox. "Climb to my head."</p>

      <p>Now the little gingerbread man was terrified, but what could he do? He climbed to the fox's ears.</p>
