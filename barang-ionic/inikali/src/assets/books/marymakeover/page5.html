<p>Mary brushed up his teeth until they were white.<br>
She polished his horns so they weren't such a fright.<br>
She curled his eyelashes and buffed every nail.<br>
She fluffed up his wings and she straightened his tail.</p>

<p>The results were AMAZING! Not a wrinkle in sight!<br>
The Monster could hardly contain his delight.<br>
He clapped his big hands and he stomped his huge feet,<br>
But Mary's makeover STILL wasn't complete!</p>

<p>She waited for calm and then said: "I suppose,<br>
It's time that we found some suitable clothes.<br>
My Daddy's quite fat, so I'm sure we can find<br>
A suit that would fit your ENORMOUS behind."</p>

<p>They went to the wardrobe and opened the door,<br>
It was haute-couture HEAVEN from ceiling to floor.<br>
There were shoes, there were suits and dresses galore!<br>
GAULTIER, GIVENCHY, CHANNEL, and DIOR!</p>

<p>The Monster was slack-jawed, his eyes open wide,<br>
He hadn't the SLIGHTEST clue how to decide<br>
Between: Prada, Armani or Gucci, or Boss.<br>
In this maze of designers he was quite at a loss!</p>

<p>But thankfully Little Miss Mary was able<br>
To find her way through the labyrinth of labels.<br>
She scoured the shelves and rummaged through rails,<br>
Convinced that the Monster would look great in tails...</p>

<p>Mary searched for her father's bespoke formal wear,<br>

"That even a MONKEY dressed up in a tux<br>
Had a GOOD chance to look like a million bucks."</p>

<p>She furnished the Monster with J.P. Tod's shoes,<br>
A Ralph Lauren shirt, then proceeded to choose<br>
A STUNNING tuxedo from Louis Vuitton<br>
And with bated breath waited - as he put it on.</p>
