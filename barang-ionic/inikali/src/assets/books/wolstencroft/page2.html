&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had arrived in the store just before Christmas when there had been a lovely big tree in the window, all decorated with fairy lights. Yards and yards of sparkling tinsel had been draped over everything, and holiday music had been playing all the time. Wolstencroft was especially fond of Jingle Bells. He liked its light, tinkling sounds. It always made him feel merry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time there had been lots of other bears to keep him company. In fact, there had been so many teddy bears crowded onto that one narrow shelf that he had scarcely had room to move.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, one by one they had all gone. Gleefully waving goodbye as they were carried off to their new homes. Until finally, he was the only teddy bear left in the entire store.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had hoped that Santa Claus would drop by on Christmas Eve and deliver him to a good home. But he hadn't. Santa had been too busy that year, delivering even more presents than usual.
</font></p>

<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolstencroft felt sad and lonely sitting there all by himself on the shelf that was high above the Christmas cards. He longed to have a child take him home and love him and play with him. But, most of all, to hug him. For no hug is ever too big for a teddy bear.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was trying hard not to cry because he knew that tears would make his eyes all puffy and red and then he would have even less chance of finding a home.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why oh why didn't someone choose him?
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, he wondered, was he passed over so many times for other less beautiful bears?
</font></p>
