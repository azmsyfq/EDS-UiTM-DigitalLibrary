<p>Within a few moments Miss Mary could tell<br>
That the dressing-up part wasn't going so well.<br>
It became pretty clear his suit wouldn't fit<br>
When the Monster bent down and his trousers split!</p>

<p>Propriety precludes me from telling you where,<br>
But it was, as you guessed, an embarrassing tear.<br>
The pants weren't designed for a beast of his size.<br>
And the rest of the clothes met a likewise demise...</p>

<p>The tailor-made tailcoat was torn into shreds!<br>
The shirt was reduced to some buttons on threads!<br>
The waistcoat was wasted! The shoes were too small;<br>
His toes burst through them, but then, worst of all...</p>

<p>The Royal Ascot top hat, which was worn to the races,<br>
Got impaled on the Monster's big horn of all places!<br>
The final result was the tux was in TATTERS...<br>
The Monster had turned haute-couture into schmattas!</p>

<p>"I cannot believe I could be so na&#239;ve!"<br>
Said Little Miss Mary a little bit peeved:<br>
"I ought to have guessed it SOOO much faster<br>
That getting you dressed would end in disaster!"</p>

<p>But the big hairy Monster was simply ecstatic,<br>
He tingled all over (though it may have been static)<br>
So what if his clothes were ripped at the seams?<br>
They MORE than exceeded his WILDEST dreams!</p>

<p><nobr>"I&nbsp;want&nbsp;to&nbsp;thank&nbsp;you&nbsp;so&nbsp;much,&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;know&nbsp;where&nbsp;to&nbsp;start?</nobr><br>
Instead of my gut, there's a place in my heart.<br>
For Mary you've changed me both inside and out.<br>
I was going to devour you... Now I'm DEVOUT!</p>

<p>I can't wait to get back to the big monsters' lair<br>
To show them my clothes, my skin and my hair.<br>
I shall teach other Monsters how not to be feared!"<br>
He thanked her once more and with that... disappeared.</p>

<p>After waving good-bye Mary drew a deep sigh,<br>
Lay back and imagined new things she could buy,<br>
But hard as she tried her dreams weren't the same,<br>
Compared to the Monster they all seemed so... tame.</p>

<p>Her entire short life she'd behaved like a brat<br>
With a "Can I have this?" and a "Can I have that!"<br>
But it looked like she'd finally found her passion;<br>
Not JUST for herself, but for big monster fashion.</p>

<p>She never imagined one day she may yearn<br>
Not for dresses or shoes, but a Monster's return.<br>
When all of a sudden, she heard something creaking.<br>
She sat up and listened to scraping and squeaking...</p>
