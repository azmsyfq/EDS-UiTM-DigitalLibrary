&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she began reading out the names she thought might suit Wolstencroft.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Adrian?" she suggested. "It's a lovely name, very dignified."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wolstencroft shook his head.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, what do you think of Bernard? It actually means brave as a bear."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wolstencroft was not impressed.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Rita left the B's and began flipping through the pages of the book, reading out a name for each letter of the alphabet starting with C.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clive, David, Edwin, Francis, Graham, Howard, Ivan, Jeremy, Keith, Leonard, Miles, Nathan, Oliver, Percy, Quentin, Rodney, Selwyn, Timothy, Ulysses, Vincent, Winston."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here she stopped because the names beginning with X, Y and Z: Xavier, Yves and Zachary, were too difficult to pronounce. There was no sense in taking a name that was even harder to say than the one he already had.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wolstencroft didn't like any of the names she suggested. At least not for himself.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They're all fine names," he said, popping a piece of chocolate into his mouth then dabbing his mouth with a napkin. "But, they're just not me."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rita stayed lost in thought for a very long time, tapping her cheek with her finger. And it wasn't until the big clock behind the pharmacy counter struck ten that she finally spoke.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I have the answer," she said. "You could have a name that's easy to say and keep your name at the same time."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolstencroft looked puzzled. "That doesn't make sense," he replied.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, but it does," Rita insisted. "You only have to shorten the name you have."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolstencroft began to look interested. "You mean I would still be Wolstencroft, but I'd have a shorter, easier to pronounce name for those who preferred it."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right," she cried excitedly. "And you have such a long name that there are several choices." And she began ticking them off on her fingers.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woolly, Wolsten, Sten or Croft. Which one do you like best?"
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolstencroft thought very carefully, mulling over each name in his mind.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like Croft," he decided at last. It's very dignified.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rita looked disappointed. "I like Woolly best," she said. "It's so cuddly and friendly. And you are woolly, you have a lovely thick coat."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolstencroft looked uncertain.
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You would still be Wolstencroft," Rita reminded him. "And that's a very dignified name indeed. Woolly would be a nice contrast."
</font></p>

<p>
<font size="4" face="georgia,times new roman,times">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked it over for well into the night as this was a very important decision. There are very few things as important as one's name.
</font></p>
