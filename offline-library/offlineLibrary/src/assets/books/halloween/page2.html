      <p>Tonight is Suzie's first Halloween at the Halloween House. She has finished her trick or treating, she did it earlier in the evening. She dressed up as a pumpkin with an orange glow--and now her two bags of candy overflow onto the floor.</p>

      <p>It's midnight and everyone's asleep. Not a peep, until suddenly there's a tapping at the door.</p>

      <p>"Tap, tap....tap." It starts out soft and low and then changes into a steady beat, beat, beat as though a giant's heart is nudging the door.</p>

      <p class="smiles">Teddy smiles.</p>

      <p>A thin mist streams from a crack in the corner, turns into a snake sliding across the floor.</p>

      <p class="smiles">Teddy smiles.</p>

      <p>Next, at the window appears a witch 200 years old with a black hat hiding half her face and the wrinkles it holds.  She slips right through the glass as though it isn't there at all. Once inside, she stands up, six feet tall.</p>

      <p class="smiles">Teddy smiles.</p>

      <p>A long legged spider with big fangs drops from the ceiling and hangs only five feet over the bed where Suzie and Picador peacefully sleep.</p>

      <p>The snake, the witch and the spider slither, creep and dangle closer, growing bigger as they go. They're up to no good. This can't be happening.</p>

      <p>But Teddy is watching. He smiles no more. The upturned side of his lip droops down, while the other part of his lip lifts up. Teddy's smile turns into a snarl.</p>

      <p>When the three monsters almost reach the bed, Teddy gets up. But more than that, he begins to grow, although much faster and bigger than they. His tennis shoes pop off and his scarf floats away. Sweet, smiling Teddy turns into a Grizzly bear, the biggest, meanest Grizzly of your imagination.</p>

      <p>Standing on his back paws, stretched to the ceiling Teddy is terrifying. Fortunately, Suzie and Picador are still sleep.</p>

      <p>The snake, the witch, and the spider stop growing. They stare at him. There's wonder and shock in their eyes. This is an unexpected surprise.</p>

      <p>Then Teddy roars! It's so loud, it doesn't help to cover your ears. And the ghouls hear it. This Grizzly is beyond their worst fears. With a puff and a poof they disappear.</p>
